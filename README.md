# Persona-based, Multimodal, Multiskill Virtual Assistant

A project I'm working on with my girlfriend [Ellie Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellienguyen5/))

This personal project will be updated more this upcoming January, as right now I am focusing on my work at Stanford OVAL Labs and Stanford NLP Labs.

Multitask, Multimodal Virtual Assistant with Persona-based Dialogues, Persona Extraction, and Active Acquisition of Persona Information. The Assistantâ€™s Persona is constructed through The Social Cognitive Theory of Personality.
 
The Assistant comes with Natural Language Understanding, Natural Language Reasoning and the ability to do a set of tasks (skill cards will be updated). The Assistant is capable of Arithmetic, Commonsense, and Symbolic Reasoning.

The Assistant will first be built using the CLI. After testings and successful validations of the Assistant's capabilities, a web interface will be developed for the Assistant.
